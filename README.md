## Building and Running the Project

We hope you have met the required Pre-Requisites mentioned above.

Kindly follow the below steps to run the project.

- Run the SQL script which is in the repository to create the basic tables for the project. (**`Pizzawale 20190821 0922.sql`**) **`ONE TIME TASK`**
- Import the project into IDE. (`Eclipse IDE`)
- In the IDE go to `Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments` and add the installed Tomcat Server.
  - Navigate to : `Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries section` & `Add Library` of type `Server Runtime` where you can mention the installed **Apache Tomcat**.
- Navigate to : `Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries section` & Add all JARs as `Add External JARs...` which are present in repository's **`lib/*`** folder.
- Bulid the project once and ensure there aren't any errors.
- DB populated with initial data, all the required build dependencies configured, *You should be able to* `Run on Server` which will start the application with tomcat server.

Navigate to [this link](http://localhost:8080/PizzaWale/#/) to see the home page of started application.

You can register to create new user and then login since the user will be added into DB.

To access previous users with admin, employee etc. profiles the credentials are avaialble *in the code* as well as they can be decoded from hashed passwords *in the SQL script* via md5 algorithm.

## Direct Run

Now you can even directly deploy and use the application. :rocket:

As mentioned above are the two pre-requisite softwares [check here](#pre-requisites)

1. You can initialize the mysql db with the script given. (**`Pizzawale 20190821 0922.sql`**)
2. Start the tomcat server and navigate to `Manager App` which would be mostly [here](http://localhost:8080/manager/html) 
	Further Navigate to `Deploy` Section > `Deploy directory or WAR file located on server` where you can define the 
	- Context Path : **/PizzaWale**
	- WAR or Directory path : **<location_to_PizzaWale.war>**
3. Click on Deploy to host the application on local system

Navigate to [this link](http://localhost:8080/PizzaWale/#/) to see the home page of started application.

## Deploying Using Docker :rocket:

**GREAT NEWS!!!....**  :smiley:

Now this application is available as on docker images also. There are two options available.

> **Docker Engine is the only pre-requisite for this**

### 1 Using docker-compose

The **`pizzawale.yaml`** file has all the needful configurations to deploy this application. 

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run **`startup.sh`** or this command to start the application: **`docker-compose -f .\pizzawale.yaml up -d`**
	This command will fetch the existing images of mysql and tomcat server and create their images customized with our application and connect them using docker's internal network. (This step might take some time in the first run to download all the images.)
3. Run **`shutdown.sh`** or this command to stop and remove the containers of this application: **`docker-compose -f .\pizzawale.yaml down`**

Navigate to [this link](http://localhost:8080/PizzaWale/#/) to see the home page of started application.

### 2 Using docker images with scripts

Here there are couple of scripts(docker commands eventually) which will create the images, containers and then connect them on an internal network.

The ready-made images for the application are already available in the docker hub repository of [dhruvinrsoni@dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dhruvinrsoni) by names of **`pizzawale-mysqldb`**, **`pizzawale-tomcatserver`**

Sr No. | Script Name | Descirption
-------|-------------|--------------
1 | **`pull.sh`** | to fetch the images required for the application and available on docker hub. 
2 | **`create.sh`** | to create containers and network, connect them in same network.
3 | **`deploy.sh`** | to start the containers which will start the application eventually. By this the application should get up with some initial time delay required for startup. Navigate to [this link](http://localhost:8080/PizzaWale/#/) to see the home page of started application.
4 | **`undeploy.sh`** | to stop the containers which will undeploy the application.
5 | **`clean.sh`** | to remove the containers and the network.
